Meta-SPDI Demonstration Programs

The files in this directory are examples showing the use of 
the Regular SPDI partition Perl library. 

To try an example, simply make sure that the MSPDI libraries can be 
directly accessed by perl. Then simply running the mspdi file creates 
the corresponding spdi file, which can then be manipulated by SPeeDI.
